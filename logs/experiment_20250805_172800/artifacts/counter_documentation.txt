Counter Module Documentation
===========================

Module Name: counter

Description:
This is an 8-bit counter module with asynchronous reset and enable control.

Features:
- 8-bit wide count output
- Asynchronous active-low reset
- Count enable control
- Automatic wrap-around on overflow

Ports:
- clk: Clock signal (positive edge triggered)
- reset: Asynchronous reset (active low)
- enable: Count enable (active high)
- count [7:0]: 8-bit counter output

Functionality:
1. On reset (low), counter resets to 0
2. When enable is high, counter increments on each clock cycle
3. When enable is low, counter holds its value
4. Counter automatically wraps around when reaching maximum value

Design Notes:
- This module is fully synthesizable
- Uses synchronous logic with asynchronous reset
- Implements safe coding practices
- Follows industry standard naming conventions
